# Order Management System

## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive database system for Pizzas-R-Us, a fictional pizzeria, designed to track and manage its day-to-day operations. The system covers aspects from pizza ordering to inventory management, offering detailed insights into the pizzeria's workflow, thus facilitating effective decision-making.

## Features
* **Enhanced ER Model:** Utilizes the Crowâ€™s Foot notation to represent the pizzeria's operational model, including pizzas, toppings, orders, customers, and discounts.
* **Database Implementation:** Implemented in MySQL, the database schema is optimized for efficient data retrieval and storage, ensuring integrity and reliability.
* **Naming Conventions:** Adheres to specific naming conventions for tables and columns to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency across the database.
* **Java Application:** A Java-based interface interacts with the database, enabling tasks such as adding new orders, viewing customer information, and generating profitability reports.

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Database Design:** The creation of an Enhanced ER model to represent the operational and relational aspects of Pizzas-R-Us.
2. **Database Implementation:** Implementation of the database in MySQL, including table creation, data insertion, and the formulation of views for reporting purposes.
3. **Java Application:** Development of a Java application to interface with the database, facilitating various operational functionalities such as order placement, order management, and inventory control.

## Installation
Please ensure you have MySQL and Java installed on your system. Clone the repository, and within the project directory, execute the SQL scripts to set up the database. Then, run the Java application to interact with the database system.

## Usage
The Java application offers a menu-driven interface for interacting with the database. Options include adding orders, viewing customer and inventory information, and generating reports on toppings popularity, profit by pizza, and profit by order type.
